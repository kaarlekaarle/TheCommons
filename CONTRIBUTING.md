# Contributing to The Commons

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Commons!  
This project is an evolving experiment, and we welcome contributors of all skill levels.

## üë£ Contribution Philosophy

We treat pull requests as conversation tools, not just merge candidates.

- **Draft PRs are encouraged**: If something breaks or behaves unexpectedly, open a draft PR to surface it.
- **Don‚Äôt worry about ‚Äúperfect‚Äù**: Flagging issues early is more useful than trying to fix everything at once.
- **All changes are reviewed** before merging‚Äîthis is intentional to avoid accidental breakage during early development.
- **Use the `#start-here` channel in Discord** for any uncertainty‚Äîask, share context, or pair up.

## üîÅ Pull Request Expectations

- **Testing first**: Pull the branch locally, run `docker compose up`, and confirm the PR does what it claims.
- **Mark it clearly**:
  - Use ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù if it's exploratory or in progress
  - Use descriptive titles and short commit messages
- **No auto-merging**: All merges go through manual verification for now
- **If it‚Äôs broken code on purpose (e.g. to show something)**, write that in the PR description

If you‚Äôre unsure where to start, check the `#start-here` channel in our Discord or open an issue. We‚Äôre happy to help you get involved.

## Working with Labels

### Quick-Start Checklist

When working with the label system:

- [ ] **Enable labels**: Set `LABELS_ENABLED=true` (backend) and `VITE_LABELS_ENABLED=true` (frontend)
- [ ] **Seed data**: Run `python backend/scripts/seed_labels.py` for default labels
- [ ] **Test flows**: Verify label creation, assignment, filtering, and delegation
- [ ] **Check performance**: Test with stress data using `make seed-stress`
- [ ] **Validate UX**: Ensure label components work across all pages

### Key Resources

- üìñ [Labels Overview](docs/labels_overview.md) - Philosophy and data model
- üõ†Ô∏è [Labels Playbook](docs/labels_playbook.md) - Practical implementation guide
- üß™ [Label System Validation](docs/label_system_validation.md) - Testing procedures

### Common Patterns

```typescript
// Frontend: Filter by label
const polls = await listPolls({ label: 'mobility' });

// Backend: Create poll with labels
poll_data = { title: "...", labels: ["mobility", "education"] }

// API: Set label-specific delegation
await setDelegation("username", "mobility");
```
