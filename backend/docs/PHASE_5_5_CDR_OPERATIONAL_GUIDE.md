pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Check module imports
python -c "from constitutional_drift_detector import ConstitutionalDriftDetector; print('OK')"
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Issue**: CDR scripts fail with database errors
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check database configuration
python scripts/constitutional_history.py --check-db

# Initialize database if needed
python scripts/constitutional_history.py --init-db
```

#### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Failures
**Issue**: Constitutional drift detection failing in CI/CD
**Solution**:
```bash
# Run drift detection locally
python scripts/constitutional_drift_detector.py

# Check environment variables
python scripts/constitutional_drift_detector.py --check-env

# Verify constitutional tests
python -m pytest tests/constitutional/ -v
```

#### 4. Alert Governance Issues
**Issue**: Alerts not being governed properly
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check alert governance status
python scripts/constitutional_alert_governance.py --status

# Reset alert governance if needed
