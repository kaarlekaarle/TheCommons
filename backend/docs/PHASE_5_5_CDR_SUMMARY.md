# Phase 5.5: Constitutional Drift Resistance (CDR) Integration Summary

## Mission Accomplished: Living CDR System Integration Complete

I have successfully implemented Phase 5.5 of the Delegation Constitutional Enforcement framework for The Commons backend. The Constitutional Drift Resistance (CDR) system is now fully integrated as a living, enforced practice across all backend workflows, CI/CD pipelines, cultural practices, and transparency dashboards.

## 🛡️ CDR Integration Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The Constitutional Drift Resistance system is now a living, enforced practice that ensures drift resistance is not just code, but practice. Every PR, deployment, and periodic audit reinforces constitutional principles, ensuring that transparency and accountability are preserved across time.
