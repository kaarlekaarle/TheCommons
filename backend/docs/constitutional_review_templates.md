# Constitutional Review Templates and Protocols

This document provides templates and protocols for conducting constitutional reviews during pull requests, ensuring that all changes uphold the Delegation Constitution principles.

## Constitutional Review Philosophy

Every code change in The Commons backend must be reviewed not just for technical correctness, but for constitutional compliance. The Delegation Constitution is not a suggestion - it is the foundation upon which the entire system is built.

## Constitutional Review Checklist

### Pre-Review Questions

Before reviewing any PR, ask yourself:

1. **Does this change affect delegation circulation?**
   - Will this change make power more or less likely to circulate?
   - Does this introduce any permanent or long-term delegation mechanisms?
   - Does this maintain the ability for immediate revocation?

2. **Does this reduce transparency?**
   - Will this change make delegation flows less visible?
   - Does this introduce any hidden or opaque mechanisms?
   - Does this maintain radical transparency?

3. **Could this normalize a shortcut?**
   - Is this a temporary workaround that might become permanent?
   - Does this bypass constitutional guardrails?
   - Could this set a precedent for future shortcuts?

4. **Does this impact user supremacy?**
   - Does this maintain user intent as the highest priority?
   - Does this preserve the right to immediate interruption?
   - Does this maintain user control over their delegated power?

5. **Does this affect anti-hierarchy principles?**
   - Could this lead to power concentration?
   - Does this maintain delegation diversity?
   - Does this preserve the anti-hierarchy mechanisms?
