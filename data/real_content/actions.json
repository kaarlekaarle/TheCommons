    "title": "Pilot AI-Assisted Feedback in Grade 9 Writing",
    "summary": "A small, time-boxed pilot where teachers use AI tools to provide formative, personalized writing feedback, with opt-in families and strict privacy rules.",
    "details": "Teachers remain in control. AI suggests formative comments (clarity, structure, examples), teachers edit/approve, and students see both teacher and AI notes. No grades from AI. Opt-in. Clear data policy. Independent evaluation at the end of the term to decide whether to scale, change, or stop.",
    "rationale": "Tests the 'teacher-first, human-centered' idea from the Living Document in a narrow, low-risk environment.",
    "guardrails": [
      "Teacher in the loop; AI recommendations are suggestions only.",
      "Transparent data policy; no student profiling; data deleted after the pilot.",
      "Opt-in with parental consent; easy opt-out at any time.",
      "Independent evaluation covering learning outcomes, workload, equity, and student experience."
