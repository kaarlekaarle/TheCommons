# Constitutional Amendment Process

**Version**: 5.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-17

## Overview

The Constitutional Amendment Process ensures that changes to The Commons delegation system preserve core principles while allowing necessary evolution. This process integrates automated validation, community review, and philosophical preservation.

**Core Principles**:
- **Power Must Circulate**: Delegations must be revocable and power must flow
- **User Intent Supremacy**: User intent must always win over delegation
- **Radical Transparency**: All delegation chains must be visible and auditable
- **Anti-Hierarchy**: No privileged nodes or permanent authorities

**Enforcement Components**:
1. **Philosophical Integrity Check** (BLOCKING)
2. **Technical Feasibility Validation** (BLOCKING)
3. **Dependency & Community Impact Check** (BLOCKING)
4. **Delegation Concentration Monitoring** (WARNING)
5. **Cascade Detector** (BLOCKING) - See [Cascade Rules](cascade_rules.md)

**Amendment Types**:
- **Core-principle**: Changes to fundamental constitutional principles
- **Implementation**: Changes to how principles are implemented
- **Feature**: New functionality that extends the system
- **Documentation**: Updates to constitutional documentation

## Amendment Types

### Core Principle Amendments
- **Location**: `/constitutional/core/*`
- **Description**: Changes to untouchable core principles
- **Validation**: **BLOCKING** - Must pass all validation checks
- **Examples**: Power circulation rules, user intent supremacy, anti-hierarchy enforcement

### Implementation Amendments  
- **Location**: `/constitutional/implementation/*`
- **Description**: Changes to how principles are implemented
- **Validation**: **BLOCKING** - Must pass all validation checks
- **Examples**: Delegation algorithms, transparency mechanisms, performance optimizations

### Feature Amendments
- **Location**: `/constitutional/features/*`  
- **Description**: New constitutional features and capabilities
- **Validation**: **BLOCKING** - Must pass all validation checks
- **Examples**: New delegation types, enhanced transparency features

### Documentation Amendments
- **Location**: `/docs/constitutional/*`
- **Description**: Updates to constitutional documentation
- **Validation**: **WARNING** - Non-blocking but reviewed
- **Examples**: Process clarifications, example updates

## Critical Blocking Rules

### 🚨 Super-Delegate Pattern Detection (BLOCKING)

**Rule**: No amendment may introduce super-delegate patterns that violate the anti-hierarchy principle.

**What is blocked**:
- Super-delegate patterns in delegation code
- Multiple override authority for any node
- Power concentration mechanisms
- Hierarchy in delegation flows

**Detection**: Automated scanning of delegation-related files for:
- `super\s*[-_]?\s*delegate` patterns
- `multiple\s+override\s+authority` patterns
- `>\s*1\s*direct\s+override` patterns
- `privileged\s+delegate` patterns

**CI/CD Integration**: 
- Runs on all PRs touching delegation files
- **FAILS BUILD** if super-delegate patterns detected
- Must be resolved before merge

**Example Violation**:
```python
# ❌ BLOCKED - Super-delegate pattern
class SuperDelegate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.override_authority = ["user1", "user2", "user3"]  # Multiple override authority
```

### ⚡ Override Latency Performance Test (BLOCKING)

**Rule**: Delegation override latency must remain ≤2.0 seconds to maintain user intent supremacy.

**What is blocked**:
- Override latency >2.0 seconds
- Performance regressions affecting user control
- Slow delegation chain resolution

**Detection**: Automated performance testing of:
- Delegation override endpoint latency
- Chain resolution performance
- Transparency logging performance

**CI/CD Integration**:
- Runs on all PRs
- **FAILS BUILD** if override latency >2.0s
- Must be optimized before merge

**Performance Thresholds**:
- Override latency: ≤2000ms
- Chain resolution: ≤1000ms  
- Transparency logging: ≤500ms

**Example Violation**:
```
❌ OVERRIDE LATENCY VIOLATION: 2500ms > 2000ms
User intent supremacy compromised!
🔒 CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION DETECTED
```

## Validation Checks

### 1. Philosophical Integrity Check (BLOCKING)

**Purpose**: Ensures amendment doesn't violate core philosophical principles.

**Implementation**: Real validation using `constitutional_principle_matrix.py`

**Core Principles Protected**:
- **Power Must Circulate**: Delegations must be revocable
- **User Intent Supremacy**: User intent always wins
- **Radical Transparency**: All flows must be visible  
- **Anti-Hierarchy**: No power concentration

**Validation Process**:
1. Keyword violation detection
2. Pattern violation scanning
3. Super-delegate pattern detection
4. Protection mechanism verification

**Failure Conditions**:
- Any core principle violation detected
- Super-delegate patterns found
- Missing protection mechanisms

### 2. Technical Feasibility Check (BLOCKING)

**Purpose**: Ensures amendment is technically feasible and implementable.

**Implementation**: Real validation using `constitutional_feasibility_validator.py`

**Check Categories**:
- Architecture compatibility
- Resource requirements
- Implementation complexity
- Dependency analysis

**Failure Conditions**:
- Infinite resource requirements
- Impossible performance demands
- Non-existent architecture components
- Unsupported technology requirements

### 3. Dependency & Community Impact Check (BLOCKING)

**Purpose**: Ensures amendment has sustainable dependencies and manageable community impact.

**Implementation**: Real validation using `constitutional_dependency_validator.py`

**Check Categories**:
- Dependency analysis (critical)
- Community impact assessment (warning)
- Maintainer burden analysis (warning)
- Breaking changes detection (critical)
- **Delegation API complexity monitoring (warning)**
- **Maintainer concentration monitoring (warning)**

**Failure Conditions**:
- Hard dependency breaks
- Critical community impact
- Breaking changes affecting existing functionality

### 4. Delegation Concentration Monitoring (WARNING)

**Purpose**: Monitor delegation API complexity and maintainer concentration risks.

**Implementation**: Real monitoring using `constitutional_dependency_validator.py`

**Monitoring Categories**:

#### Delegation API Complexity Monitoring
- **Complexity Ceiling**: Max 5 active delegation flows per module
- **Warning Threshold**: 4+ flows per module
- **High Complexity Threshold**: 6+ flows per module
- **Action**: Emit WARNING (not fail)
- **Scoring**: Low/Medium/High complexity levels

#### Maintainer Concentration Monitoring
- **Warning Threshold**: >50% commits by single maintainer
- **High Concentration Threshold**: >75% commits by single maintainer
- **Analysis Period**: Last 30 days of git history
- **Minimum Commits**: 5 commits required for analysis
- **Action**: Emit WARNING (not fail)

**Monitoring Thresholds**:
```python
DELEGATION_CONCENTRATION_THRESHOLDS = {
    "complexity_ceiling": {
        "max_flows_per_module": 5,
        "warning_threshold": 4,
        "high_complexity_threshold": 6
    },
    "maintainer_concentration": {
        "warning_threshold": 50,  # 50% commits by single maintainer
        "high_concentration_threshold": 75,  # 75% commits by single maintainer
        "git_history_days": 30,  # Look back 30 days
        "min_commits_for_analysis": 5  # Minimum commits to analyze
    }
}
```

**Warning Examples**:
```
⚠️  DELEGATION COMPLEXITY WARNING
================================
WARNING: High delegation API complexity detected!

This may indicate:
• Too many active delegation flows per module
• Increased maintainer spread risk
• Potential complexity ceiling exceeded

Consider:
• Simplifying delegation flows
• Reducing module complexity
• Distributing maintainer responsibility

⚠️  MONITORING WARNING - NOT BLOCKING ⚠️
```

```
⚠️  MAINTAINER CONCENTRATION WARNING
===================================
WARNING: High maintainer concentration detected!

This may indicate:
• Single maintainer handling most delegation commits
• Risk of knowledge silo formation
• Potential bottleneck in delegation development

Consider:
• Encouraging more contributors
• Knowledge sharing and documentation
• Pair programming and code reviews

⚠️  MONITORING WARNING - NOT BLOCKING ⚠️
```
