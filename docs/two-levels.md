# The Commons: Two‑Level Decision Thinking

The why, not the how

## 1) Two different kinds of choices humans make {#two-kinds}

### Level A — Direction (slow, high‑altitude)

- **Question:** What kind of world do we want to live in?
- **Nature:** Principles, values, long‑term constraints, shared north stars.
- **Cadence:** Rarely changed, deliberately slow to update.
- **Psychology:** People need stable meaning and identity. Stable, publicly agreed principles reduce anxiety and tribal defensiveness because the "rules of the game" feel safe and predictable.

### Level B — Action (fast, on the ground)

- **Question:** What should we do about this specific issue right now?
- **Nature:** Concrete choices, trade‑offs, implementation details.
- **Cadence:** Ongoing; can be quick.
- **Psychology:** People differ in time/attention. Some want to dive deep, others want to delegate. Fast action keeps momentum and prevents cynicism from "endless talk."

**Key idea:** Level A protects coherence; Level B protects responsiveness. Keeping them distinct lowers conflict and improves trust.

## 2) Why this separation matters (behavioral reasons) {#why}

1. **Cognitive load:** Big moral questions and specific policy details use different mental muscles. Mixing them overwhelms people and produces shallow participation. Splitting layers lets citizens engage where they have energy.

2. **Procedural justice:** People accept outcomes they dislike if they feel the process was clear and fair. A stable Level‑A charter + transparent Level‑B execution gives that fairness.

3. **Polarization reduction:** Arguing values and tactics at the same time causes identity battles. Level A hosts value negotiation infrequently and carefully; Level B sticks to "given our values, what works?"

4. **Commitment vs. flexibility:** Humans want both: a durable moral floor and room to adapt. Level A sets the floor (rights, guardrails). Level B experiments within it.

5. **Motivation & dignity:** Not everyone can be "always‑on." Fluid delegation (see below) lets busy people still matter without guilt. Revocable, low‑friction delegation preserves agency and dignity.

## 3) How decisions flow (human experience, not code) {#flow}

1. **Frame the issue (Level B starts):** What decision is needed? Who's affected? What constraints from Level A apply?

2. **Sanity check against Level A:** Does any option violate the shared principles/rights? If yes, it's out without needing a culture war.

3. **Deliberate in public:** Plain‑language summaries, pro/con, uncertainty. People can read, comment, or delegate.

4. **Choose your mode of participation:** Direct; Delegate; Reclaim any time.

5. **Decision & implementation.**

6. **Feedback loop.**

## 4) Delegation as a social psychology feature (not a hack) {#delegation}

Why people delegate; trust networks; revocability; granularity by topic/time.

## 5) Guardrails that keep the system sane {#guardrails}

- Rights floor
- Emergency mode with sunsets
- Evidence & memory
- Drift checks

## 6) Participation that meets people where they are {#participation}

- Two‑click journeys
- Progressive disclosure
- Plain language first
- Positive rituals

## 7) How Level A evolves (rarely, carefully) {#evolution}

Cadence; bar to change; input sources; outcome.

## 8) Failure modes to anticipate (and the antidotes) {#failure-modes}

### Risks & antidotes

- Endless debate
- Delegate capture
- Technocracy drift
- Majority tyranny
- Apathy

## 9) The invariants to preserve in any implementation {#invariants}

- Separation of layers
- Consent & reversibility
- Transparency with kindness
- Memory & learning
- Accessibility
- Dignity

## One‑sentence essence {#essence}

> "Level A states who we are; Level B decides what we do now—linked by trust, protected by rights, and paced for human minds."
