# The Commons: Two-Level Decision Thinking

## The Core Idea
Not all decisions are the same. Some set the direction for years to come (Level A), others are about what to do right now (Level B). Mixing them creates confusion and conflict.

Two levels make things clear:
- Level A: Long-term principles and values.
- Level B: Immediate actions.

## Why Separate Them?
When we know which level we're in, we avoid arguing past each other. Principles guide actions, and actions stay in line with principles.

Without this separation, urgent matters can override long-term direction, or big values debates can stall simple fixes.

## How It Works
1. **Agree on Principles (Level A)**
   - These are the values we stand on.
   - Changed rarely, with clear discussion.
2. **Decide on Actions (Level B)**
   - Specific, immediate steps.
   - Decided quickly, but must fit Level A.

## Decision Flow
- New idea comes in → Is it a principle or an action?
- If principle: Goes to Level A.
- If action: Goes to Level B, checked against Level A.

## Delegation
You can let someone you trust vote for you. You keep the right to take that back at any time.

## Guardrails
- All decisions are public.
- All votes and delegations are reversible.
- Anyone can propose, comment, and vote.

## Participation
The more people take part, the stronger the decisions. Even if you don't propose or vote, knowing you can builds trust.

## Evolution
Communities change. So can their principles — but only through clear, open change processes.

## Common Failure Modes
- **Mixing Levels** – Arguing about values when deciding on a quick fix, or making a values shift without calling it one.
- **Hidden Decisions** – Choices made without public visibility.
- **Locked Power** – Delegations that can't be undone.

## Invariants (Always True)
- Principles guide actions.
- All processes are open.
- Participation is a right, not a favour.

Two levels keep decisions clear, honest, and connected to the community's values. That's the foundation of The Commons.
